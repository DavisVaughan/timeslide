The goal of warp is to provide tooling to group dates by a variety of periods, such as: yearly, monthly, by second, by week of the month, and more.

```{r}
library(warp)
```

## Installation

You can install the release version from CRAN with:

```r
install.package("warp")
```

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("DavisVaughan/warp")
```

## Example

One of the core functions in warp is `warp_distance()`, which allows you to provide a date time vector and compute the "distance" from an `origin`. For example, this computes the number of months from the unix epoch.

```{r}
x <- as.Date("1970-01-01") + -2:2
x

warp_distance(x, period = "month")
```

The values that `warp_distance()` returns correspond to the distance from `x` to the `origin`, in units defined by the `period` and the width defined by `every`. The `origin` defaults to the unix epoch of `1970-01-01 00:00:00` in the time zone of `x`, but you can change that. In this case the distances are saying that, for example, `"1970-01-02"` is in the same month as the origin, and `"1969-12-31"` is 1 month group away.

You can also compute daily distances. Rather than grouping by 1 day, let's lump every 2 days together, starting from the default `origin`.

```{r}
# Groups 1970-01-01 and 1970-01-02 together
warp_distance(x, period = "day", every = 2)
```

You will often want to set your own `origin` date. Let's shift it forward 1 to `1970-01-02`.

```{r}
origin <- as.Date("1970-01-02")
origin

# Groups 1970-01-02 and 1970-01-03 together
warp_distance(x, period = "day", every = 2, origin = origin)
```

Another interesting period to group by is the `"mweek"`, i.e. the week of the month. Notice that days 1-7 of January 1970 are grouped into the same bucket. Also note that days 29-31 of December 1969 fell at the end of their corresponding month. This irregular week of size 3 is treated as the 5th week of that month, but the offset value of `-1` is still the number of week buckets from the `origin` of `1970-01-01`.

```{r}
y <- as.Date("1969-12-28") + 0:14

tibble::tibble(
  y = y,
  mweek = warp_distance(y, "mweek")
)
```


## Inspiration

The algorithm for `warp_distance()` was inspired by `xts::endpoints()`.
